# CSC370
Coursework for UVIC's CSC370, Fall 2019

The main outline of this course was to develop a database for a topic. The topic I chose was free universal education. Phases 1 & 2 outline various schematics and designs of the database, including relationships, keys, attributes and more. Phase 3 is the implementation of the database and Phase 4 was a presentation/recap of the project. I received an A+ in the course.
